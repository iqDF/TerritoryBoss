## Before you get started

Itâ€™s not recommended to immediately dive into this game development if you have no prior C++ experience. If you are completely new to Unreal Engine 4 I recommend you to read https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/GettingStarted/index.html

Required Third Party Software
---------------------

**Windows:**

Be sure to have [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs-2015-product-editions) installed.  You can use any desktop version of [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/), including the free version called Community 2015.

You need [DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) to avoid compilation errors.  Most users will already have this, if you have ever installed DirectX runtimes to play a game.
 
**Mac OSX:**

Be sure to have [Xcode 5.1](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) installed.
